## Understanding Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries, automating tasks, and creating new opportunities.  

It is essential to understand the basics to fully appreciate its potential.  

**1. Introduction to AI**  

Artificial Intelligence involves the simulation of human intelligence in machines.  
These machines are designed to think, learn, and perform tasks that would typically require human intervention.  

**2. Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on building systems that learn from data and improve over time.  
**Deep Learning** is a more advanced subset that uses neural networks to solve complex problems.  

**3. Key Concepts**

* **Supervised Learning**: Models are trained on labeled data to make predictions.  

* **Unsupervised Learning**: Models learn patterns from unlabeled data.  

**4. Applications of AI**

AI is used in a variety of applications, from healthcare (predicting patient outcomes) to finance (fraud detection).  
Self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and recommendation engines are all powered by AI.
